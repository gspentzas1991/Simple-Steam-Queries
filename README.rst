Simple-Steam-Queries
=========
A python module that allows you to easily run Steam client `Master Server Query Protocol <https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Master_Server_Query_Protocol>`_ queries and get a list of steam servers

Install
-------

Install latest release version from PYPI:

.. code:: bash

    pip install Simple-Steam-Queries
    
Usage Guide
-------
Steam server queries are being run through the steam client. Simple-Steam-Queries uses the `ValvePython steam <https://github.com/ValvePython/steam>`_ client module to execute the queries.

* The first step is to login to the steam client by calling the sign_in function with a steam account's username and password credentials. If the account requires 2FA, it will be asked on the command line. It's recomended to use a secrets.env file for this (`see example <https://github.com/gspentzas1991/GameSnoop-Server/blob/37d79c45328f36d9b70133b59a9999cacfbdbbf5/server.py#L187>`_)
* In order to build your query, you need to create a list of SteamQueryParam objects. These objects describe the types of servers you want to receive with an implicit logical AND between the parameters

Example:

.. code:: python

    params = [SteamQueryParam.Secure,SteamQueryParam.NotEmpty] 
    
describes a query that will search for password protected and not empty steam servers

* After you created your SteamQueryParam list, you call the SteamServerQuery function and pass your parameter list to it. This will return the final string query that corresponds to the parameters. 

Example:

.. code:: python

    params = [SteamQueryParam.Secure,SteamQueryParam.NotEmpty] 
    query = SteamServerQuery(params).get_query()
    #query will have the value "\secure\1\empty\1"

* Finally you can call the get_server_list function with your string query as parameter, and it will return a list of steam servers

Example:

.. code:: python

    params = [SteamQueryParam.Secure,SteamQueryParam.NotEmpty] 
    query = SteamServerQuery(params).get_query()
    game_servers = get_server_list(query)

Logic Operators
-------
Each SteamQueryParam on your parameter list is implicitely connected with a logical AND. You can apply other logic operations by using the generate_logical_query function. MSQP syntax for logic operators is like this : \\operator\\operandsCount\\param1\\param2

Example:

.. code:: python

  params = [SteamQueryParam.Secure,SteamQueryParam.NotEmpty]
  SteamQueryParam.generate_logical_query(Logical.OR,params)
  
This will return a query that will return servers that are either password protected or not empty. The returning string query would be: "\\or\\2\\secure\\1\\empty\\1"

The library supports the OR, AND, NOR, NAND operators

Aditional Parameters
-------
Some SteamQueryParams should be used with additional parameters. In such cases there are get functions that accept parameters, to create the query.

Example:

.. code:: python

    params = [SteamQueryParam.get_appId_param(1604030),SteamQueryParam.get_servername_param('myServer'),SteamQueryParam.get_gametype_param('pvp')]
    #The above parameters describe a query that searches for servers with appId=1604030, name like \*myServer\* and gametype of 'pvp'


Notes
-------
Steam queries seem to return a maximum of 20k servers per request. If you need bigger results you will need to break the query into multiple smaller queries and collect the results together (`see example <https://github.com/gspentzas1991/GameSnoop-Server/blob/37d79c45328f36d9b70133b59a9999cacfbdbbf5/server.py#L117>`_)
